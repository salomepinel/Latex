  abstract = {Efficient allocation of resources is of paramount importance in building reliable and efficient transportation systems. This is particularly true because of the key role that transportation plays in the economic development of any region. Despite continuing efforts by economists, planners, and transportation system analysts to determine the relationship between transportation investment and economic development, the correlation is yet to be understood clearly. One of the most intriguing matters is the time lag between the two. Transportation investments have a complex, dynamic influence on economic systems. They generate both direct and indirect benefits, and they have short-term effects such as an increase in construction-related employment and an increase in markets for local goods and services, as well as longer-term effects such as the establishment of new industries that are attracted by increased access to local goods and services. The time lag between transportation investment and economic return significantly affects how the benefits of an investment are evaluated. This paper examines a framework for evaluation based on the data envelopment analysis technique that captures the dynamic relationship between transportation investment and economic development. In the analysis performed, a strong correlation was observed between the relative scarcity of transportation infrastructure, as compared with other input parameters in the production process, and a lag time between investment and the materialization of economic return. Short-, medium-, and long-term time lags were analyzed in the study, and it is suggested that current demand for increased accessibility is correlated with the dynamic characteristics of time lag with spatial variation.},

  abstract = {The substantial volume, continued growth, and resulting complexity of the scientific literature not only increases the need for systematic, replicable, and rigorous literature reviews, but also highlights the natural limits of human researchers’ information processing capabilities. In search of a solution to this dilemma, computational techniques are beginning to support human researchers in synthesizing large bodies of literature. However, actionable methodological guidance on how to design, conduct, and document such computationally augmented literature reviews is lacking to date. We respond by introducing and defining computational literature reviews (CLRs) as a new review method and put forward a six-step roadmap, covering the CLR process from identifying the review objectives to selecting algorithms and reporting findings. We make the CLR method accessible to novice and expert users alike by identifying critical design decisions and typical challenges for each step and provide practical guidelines for tailoring the CLR method to four conceptual review goals. As such, we present CLRs as a literature review method where the choice, design, and implementation of a CLR are guided by specific review objectives, methodological capabilities, and resource constraints of the human researcher.},

  abstract = {Chicago's South Side has long been characterized as a “transit desert” – an area with high transit inaccessibility and insufficient infrastructure to meet residents' needs (Jiao \& Dillivan, 2013). Without adequate transit, residents cannot reach employment opportunities or regional amenities – contributing to economic, spatial, and social marginalization. The Chicago Transit Authority's proposed Red Line Extension (RLE) is designed to connect the city's far south side neighborhoods to Chicago's core. Given the scope of the RLE, 175 parcels have been chosen for demolition, meaning that a similar number of households face displacement to make room for the RLE right of way – which may have potentially negative consequences in realizing the subsequent benefits of improved transit access. In this article, we perform an ex-ante analysis of RLE induced displacement. Specifically, we: 1) predict potential location choices that transit displacees are most likely to choose; and 2) analyze these locations in relation to access to transit, amenities, employment, and housing affordability, among others. Within the context of transportation planning, ex-ante analysis is important because it can minimize unintended and negative consequences of transit-induced displacement – like decreased transit access and a loss of potential neighborhood improvements - by predicting potential relocation choices for displacees. Such predicted choices can help planners and decision-makers better understand the trade-offs for directly affected households and thereby allow planners and decision-makers to assist in relocation assistance that maximizes the benefits of the necessarily displaced.},

  abstract = {The combined decentralisation of many firms and services and the increasing concentration of traditional public transport services in the main corridors of urban centres have made it more difficult for people to access jobs, in particular when residing outside these prime accessibility areas. This is the first national study within the context of Great Britain to examine whether better public transport job accessibility, modelled at the micro level of individuals, improves employment probabilities for people living in Great Britain. While previous studies have typically concentrated on US metropolitan areas, our study uses British national employment micro datasets to assess which urban and rural areas and population groups would benefit from better public transport services. In an important departure from most standard accessibility methodologies, we computed a public transport job accessibility measure applied nationwide and combined this with individual-level employment probability models for Great Britain. The models were corrected for endogeneity by applying an instrumental variable approach. The study finds that better public transport job accessibility improves individual employment probabilities, in particular in metropolitan areas and smaller cities and towns with lower car ownership rates and in low-income neighbourhoods. It further shows that mainly lower educated groups and young people would benefit from better public transport job accessibility. The findings in this study are important for policymakers in that they imply that, in particular, job seekers who rely on public transport services may benefit from more targeted public policies to improve their accessibility to employment and thereby their social mobility.},

  abstract = {The role of transport in providing access to employment has received considerable attention. Since transport policies may be motivated by assumed effects on employment probability outcomes, it is important to establish the nature of the relationship between transport and employment outcomes. While the majority of the empirical evidence suggests a positive association, it is not conclusive or consistent and often shows mixed results. To address this confusion, our study has systematically reviewed this evidence base and synthesised it through meta-analysis. We first identified 93 studies that quantitatively assessed the impact of transport on employment outcomes. By systematically merging the empirical evidence, this study establishes a positive association between transport and employment outcomes, with varying effects for four identified categories of transport measures (or combinations thereof): car ownership, public transport access, commute times, and job accessibility levels. This positive association persists in studies that control for endogeneity between transport and employment, but a larger evidence base is needed to establish a more robust relationship, in particular for cities and smaller (rural) areas outside the US-context and with regard to public transport. We then selected 20 methodologically comparable studies for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Our meta-regression models clearly demonstrate that car ownership significantly increases individual employment probabilities, in particular among welfare recipients. Young drivers benefit from access to household cars when these are not in use by their parents, and they are more sensitive to the time and cost implications of longer commutes. While our systematic review suggests that better access to public transport and higher levels of job accessibility increases employment probabilities, meta-regression analysis requires more consistent transport measures. The findings in this study are important for policymakers in that they imply that job seekers may benefit from public policies targeted at improving their access to public transport, in particular for people without access to cars and in areas with fewer job opportunities.},

  abstract = {Numerous studies have found positive correlation between transportation infrastructure investment and economic development. Basically these studies use a conventional production function model augmented by a public capital input, mainly highways, rail and other transportation facilities. While the range of the measured economic growth effects varies widely among studies, the positive elasticity between transportation investment and economic development is now commonly accepted. Still a major puzzling issue is that the magnitude of the measured effect seems to decline significantly as the econometric model is further refined, mainly with regard to space and time lags. That is, the use of national or state data produces elasticity results, which are much larger than when using county or municipality data. Similarly, when we introduce into the econometric model a lag between the times when the transportation investments are made and when the economic benefits transpire, the measured elasticities decline with the size of the lag. Thus, the main objective of this paper is to investigate these issues analytically and empirically and provide a plausible explanation. We do so by using alternative econometric models, applying them to a database, which is composed of longitudinal state, county and municipality observations from 1990 to 2000. The key result is that transportation investments produce strong spillover effects relative to space and time. Unless these factors are properly accounted for many reported empirical results are likely to be overly biased, with important policy implications.},

At a microlevel, however, it is not quite clear how to model and measure the effects of an additional investment in a transportation facility like a highway or rail link on local economic growth. This issue is further exacerbated by the fact that negative environmental externalities from infrastructure expansion are mainly experienced at the urban and regional level and thus strongly affect their economic well being. Given these realities, this paper examines the critical issues involved in analyzing the economic effects of local infrastructure investments and then proceeds to propose a model which shows analytically the impact of changes in accessibility, caused by infrastructure expansion, on location and output decisions, and on the use of labor by production firms.},

  abstract = {One of the goals of constructing and operating an extensive rail transit system in the Denver metro region since 1994 has been growth and development of land use along the rail transit system. This paper analyzes the trend of land use growth and development around the rail transit system mostly from 2000 to 2010. Primarily land parcel data collected from the assessor's office of several counties in the metro region have been used to determine change in the amount of different types of land use namely commercial, mixed, industrial, multi-family residential and single-family residential near and far from the rail transit system. Change has been analyzed in terms of total square footage of the building areas as well as land use density. Statistical significance tests (Wilcoxon/Kruskal–Wallis test) have been conducted to understand if the amount of change taking place near the rail transit system is greater than away from the system. The growth of commercial land use was significantly higher near the rail transit system. More growth in multi-family residential land use has also occurred near the rail transit system, but was not significantly greater than areas away from the system. Single-family residential land use has noticeably increased in places away from the rail transit system. The other types of land use have not shown any consistent pattern in their growth either near or away from the system. Overall, a noticeable amount of land use change, especially commercial land use, has taken place around the rail transit system from 2000 to 2010. However, this change in land use cannot necessarily be attributed to the construction and operation of the rail transit system. Other factors may have influenced the growth of land use around the rail transit system more than the presence of the rail transit system itself.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the wider benefits of major investments in urban transport and discusses the relevance of giving attention to time and geographical scale in the analysis of employment growth before, under and after the introduction of new urban transport infrastructure. Using descriptive statistics in combination with OLS modelling, the paper analyses the intra-urban employment growth by workplace in regard to the opening of the Copenhagen Metro in 2002. The study identifies strong employment growth in the case of Copenhagen and higher employment growth in metro-served areas compared to non-metro-served areas in the first ten years after the opening of the Metro. The study also finds that when zooming in on the local scale, employment growth has been unevenly distributed along the metro corridor leading to a spatial restructuring of intra-urban employment patterns. This highlights that geographical scale and time is of critical importance when addressing the development of employment in areas that have witnessed investment in infrastructure. Moreover, the paper shows that especially the existing urban structures of the built environment, supporting planning policies, the local economic context and the preconditions for the development seems to be of great importance when assessing intra-urban restructuring of employment.},

  abstract = {This paper examines whether rail transit stations tend to increase employment opportunities in nearby neighbourhoods and whether rail transit tends to be placed in neighbourhoods which connects to higher‐wage jobs. The results show no significant relative increase in the level of employment in neighbourhoods near rail stations post opening of the first light rail line in Charlotte, NC. However, the line connects to areas with significantly higher shares of high‐wage workers and industries. While creating accessibility to higher‐skilled jobs may result in greater economic impacts, it may conflict with goals of increasing employment opportunities for transit dependent, lower‐wage workers. Resumen Este artículo examina si las estaciones de tránsito ferroviario tienden a aumentar las oportunidades de empleo en los vecindarios cercanos y si el tránsito ferroviario tiende a ubicarse en vecindarios conectados a empleos mejor remunerados. Los resultados no muestran un aumento relativo significativo en el nivel de empleo en los barrios cercanos a las estaciones de tren después de la apertura de la primera línea de ferrocarril ligero en Charlotte (Carolina del Norte). Sin embargo, la línea conecta con áreas con porcentajes significativamente más altos de trabajadores e industrias con salarios elevados. Si bien la creación de acceso a empleos más cualificados puede tener como resultado un mayor impacto económico, esto puede estar en conflicto con los objetivos de aumentar las oportunidades de empleo para los trabajadores que dependen del transporte público y perciben salarios más bajos. 抄録 本稿では、鉄道のトランジットステーションが、付近の居住区 (neighbourhood)における雇用機会を増加させる傾向があるか否か、また、賃金の高い仕事につながる居住区に立地する傾向があるか否かを検討する。ノースカロライナ州のシャーロットで最初のライトレール路線が開通した後では、駅付近の居住区の雇用水準には、有意な相対的な増加は認められなかった。しかしながら、ライトレールの路線が、賃金の高い労働者と産業の割合が有意に高い地域同士を結ぶように走っていることが示された。より高度なスキルを要する職業への就業可能性を生むことにより大きな経済的影響がもたらされる可能性があるが、それがトランジットに依存する低賃金労働者のための雇用機会を増やすという目標と競合する可能性がある。},

Using the building permit data of the city of St. Paul, this study investigates the effects of key announcements of the Green Line light rail transit (LRT) by employing location quotient analysis and difference-in-difference models to compare building activity in the LRT corridor and control corridors. We found that the announcement of preliminary engineering had no positive impacts on the count and value of building permits whereas the announcement of Full Funding Grant Agreement tended to increase the number of building permit by about 24\% and the value by 80\%. We concluded that LRT investment, in conjunction with proactive land use planning policies, public subsidies and public funded projects, increases building activity.},

  abstract = {In the last few decades, changes in consumer habits have been observed in household economies. These habits now focus on large retail chains and shopping centers out-of-town rather than independent retailers sited, for the most part, in shopping districts or in the town center. One factor in this trend is the retailer’s accessibility to the customer. Because of this relationship, the retail market share is affected by the development of an efficient transport system, such as the Metro. This paper examines both short- and long-term positive and negative interactions between the retail sector and the introduction of the Metro using empirical evidence from three middle-sized Spanish cities (Bilbao, Málaga and Seville). It also analyzes how retailers assess the influence of a nearby Metro station on their business. Finally, the conclusion is drawn that a new planning model for urban transportation infrastructure works is beginning to prevail with the backing of smallbusiness association lobbies. This model seeks to minimize the effect of works-related negative externalities on urban retail fabrics but can never guarantee a happy ending for independent stores.},

  abstract = {Land around urban rail transit stations can be valuable because it is so accessible. Joint development of transit stations and nearby office buildings occurs because both the public and private sectors recognize its financial rewards. This article examines how transit investments and joint development in particular affect five indicators of office market conditions: average rents; vacancy rates; absorption rates; densities; and shares of new and total office and commercial construction near the stations. Data are examined for five rail stations in the Washington, D.C. and Atlanta areas over the 1978–89 period. Average office rents near stations rose with systemwide rider ship; joint development projects added more than three dollars per gross square foot to annual office rents. Office vacancy rates were lower, average building densities higher, and shares of regional growth larger in station areas with joint development projects. Where regional market conditions are favorable, rail transit appears capable of positive impacts on station area office markets. Combining transit investments with private real estate projects appears to strengthen these effects. The findings suggest that the rationale behind value recapture and other benefit-sharing programs is economically sound for conditions similar to those of the case study areas.},

  abstract = {Planners of the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system, the first large-scale urban rail project built in the U.S. since the early part of this century, hoped BART would encourage compact and orderly growth, and spawn a multi-centered settlement pattern. The initial BART impact study, conducted a few years following the system's 1973 opening, concluded that BART played a fairly modest, though not inconsequential, role in shaping metropolitan growth and land-use patterns. This paper summarizes findings from an update of the original BART impact study, examining BART's influences on urban development patterns 20 years after services started. In general, our findings are similar to those of the original impact study. Over the past 20 years, land-use changes associated with BART have been largely localized, limited to downtown San Francisco and Oakland and a handful of suburban stations. Elsewhere, few land-use changes have occurred, either because of neighborhood opposition or a lackluster local real estate market. While BART appears to have helped bring about a more multi-centered regional settlement pattern, such as inducing midrise office development near the Walnut Creek and Concord stations, it has done little to stem the tide of freeway-oriented suburban employment growth over the past two decades. Indeed, recent office additions near East Bay stations pale in comparison to the amount of floorspace built in non-BART freeway corridors. Near several suburban stations, the most notable change has been the addition of multi-family housing. In most instances, local redevelopment authorities helped leverage these projects by providing various financial incentives and assistance with land assemblege. Statistical analyses reveal that the availability of vacant and developable land is an important predictor of whether land-use changes occurred near stations. BART, in and of itself, has clearly not been able to induce large-scale land-use changes, though under the right circumstances, it appears to have been an important contributor. If the Bay Area is to achieve the compact, multi-centered built form that was originally envisaged, we conclude that stronger public policy initiatives will be needed to channel future regional growth to BART corridors.},

An empirical analysis focuses on the relation between proximity to new stations and firm survival following the announcement of the extension of the orange line of the metro in Montréal (Canada) between 1996 and 2016. To do so, a Cox Proportional Hazards model is estimated using the simultaneous announcement of two potential extensions to define the treatment (new stations) and control groups (speculative stations) based on the distance to the closest stations. The model explicitly controls for anticipation and speculation effect by introducing three distinct treatment effects by period. The impact of the new metro stations appears to be mostly positive on firms’ survival probability during the construction period and after the opening of the service. The results suggest that the metro extension does have a positive influence on the survival rates of individual firms within 250 to 1,250~m. of the closest station, especially for local activities.},

  abstract = {As central cities in California continue their renaissance, commercial gentrification is often identified by residents as a concern. For many, commercial gentrification means the intrusion of new businesses that force out a favorite food shop or a longstanding retail store because of higher rents. For others, it means an influx of hip cafés, trendy retail boutiques, and gourmet fast food restaurants - places that change the fabric of their familiar neighborhood, for better or for worse. For many merchants, commercial gentrification can have implications for economic survival, as increased rents may lead to displacement and business closures. This report was born out of these concerns, which we uncovered when interviewing community stakeholders as part of our earlier research on residential gentrification in Los Angeles and the Bay Area (See Chapple, Loukaitou-Sideris, Waddell, Chatman, \&amp; Ong, 2017). Over the course of this past work, interviews with community members and planners revealed rapidly-changing storefronts to be a recurring concern. As we looked deeper into this phenomenon, we found that potential relationships between commercial gentrification and transit-oriented development (TOD), transit ridership, and traffic safety were relatively unexplored. This report focuses on the San Francisco Bay and Los Angeles regions and addresses gaps in our understanding of the relationship between commercial gentrification and TOD, rail transit ridership, and traffic safety. The primary elements of this report are: ● A literature review of research on commercial gentrification. ● The development of a quantitative metric that defines commercial gentrification based on four objective parameters. ● Statistical analyses that explore associations between commercial gentrification and rail transit stations, changes in transit ridership, and traffic safety. ● Qualitative examinations of four case study neighborhoods: two in Los Angeles and two in the Bay Area. Using these methods, we produced the following research findings: ● Commercially gentrified stations are generally characterized by an influx of eateries, cafés, and bars. ● Proximity to a transit station is likely not associated with commercial gentrification. More important factors that may relate to commercial gentrification are the demographic characteristics of a neighborhood, particularly the percent of non-Hispanic black, foreign born, and renter residents, as well as overall population density. In some contexts, residential gentrification may lead to commercial gentrification. Commercial gentrification may contribute to increases in total, cyclist-involved, and pedestrian-involved average annual crashes around rail transit stations. It is unclear if this is directly due to the phenomenon of commercial gentrification or if it is related to an increase in traffic that occurs in commercially gentrified areas. ● Commercial gentrification does not appear to have a significant effect on rail transit ridership. Residential gentrification in Los Angeles, on the other hand, may lead to reduced rates of transit ridership in the decade after the residential gentrification occurs. 5 ● Merchants generally indicated that rising rent costs were the most prominent aspect of neighborhood change putting pressure on their businesses’ bottom line. Following these conclusions, we recommend the following as prudent municipal, state, and regional policies to mitigate traffic crash impacts and empower transit-oriented development: ● While our quantitative research does not find a significant relationship between a neighborhood’s proximity to transit and commercial gentrification, this may not represent a universal truth, and this issue certainly requires further probing. Policymakers should not simply assume that transit neighborhoods are not susceptible to commercial gentrification. ● The relationship between residential and commercial gentrification also needs further exploration. The results of this study are rather mixed, and it is not clear when and where one type of gentrification follows the other, or which comes first. We suspect that there may not be a universal pattern, and this relationship may change from one neighborhood to the other. ● Our findings indicate that commercial gentrification is context-specific. Policymakers, therefore, should not only rely on aggregate data but also seek to identify what is happening on the ground in specific commercial transit neighborhoods. Commercial neighborhood stakeholders, such as merchants, property owners, and realtors can provide good information about gentrification trends, business closures, relocations, rent increases, etc. ● Commercial gentrification in a transit neighborhood is often accompanied by an increased incidence of crashes involving pedestrians and cyclists. This may well be because more pedestrians and cyclists are present in the neighborhood, increasing rates of exposure. Regardless of cause, the increased occurrence of crashes tells us that policymakers should focus resources towards traffic calming, safe streets infrastructure provision, and other proven traffic safety improvements.},

  abstract = {The formation of new firms is one process by which economies grow and innovate. Public transportation services may facilitate the birth of new firms by both providing better access and causing local densification that leads to agglomeration economies. In this study firm births are investigated to determine how they are related to newly provided light rail transit service in two metropolitan areas in the United States. A geocoded time-series database of firm establishments in Dallas, Texas, and Portland, Oregon, from 1991 through 2008 is used. The data set allows the study of spatial patterns by industry and the analysis of the relationship of firm births to rail station proximity, accessibility, and local agglomeration while controlling for a number of potentially confounding factors. Positive, large, and statistically significant relationships are found in Portland between rail station proximity and firm births. The rail proximity results in Dallas are also generally positive, though not as large; this finding is consistent with the smaller accessibility value of rail in Dallas, as well as policies encouraging commercial development near rail in Portland. Rail proximity increases firm births across almost all industrial sectors in both of these metropolitan areas when controlling for the negative effects on firm births of local own-industry employment. Local block-level agglomeration and generalized accessibility are also highly significant but appear to work independently of rail access. These results imply that passenger rail service increases firm births near rail stations by expanding access to the labor market but not by increasing information spillovers or increasing face-to-face interactions.},

India has seen urbanisation without infrastructure due to unplanned expansion and urban sprawl, a pattern of low-density, haphazard growth that strains resources, especially in developing cities like Jammu. Because of its growing population and spatial fragmentation, the city must be developed within the context of the surrounding area. New improvements are progressively addressing these deficiencies in infrastructure facilities. The city is currently considering a transformative project: constructing a metro system, defined as a high-capacity rail network designed to integrate land use and transportation planning. This study addresses two core research questions: How does metro infrastructure reconfigure mono-nodal commercial zones in historically unplanned cities like Jammu? The performance of the transport network is determined by the availability of technological space, whereas the viability of development is determined by commerce regions and the interest of investors in it. Understanding the interaction between commercial hubs and transit nodes in Jammu City helps build the research base. This aids in comprehending the objectives set forth to accomplish the same and the future requirements of the commercial zones. The metro construction will increase potential opportunities, according to current development plans. The future of the business zones may, therefore, be significantly altered. This paper contributes to understanding the impact of metro development and envisions a decentralized, multi-nodal future for Jammu’s commercial zones.},

Our aim was to describe the process, facilitators, and barriers to completing the first 2-week full SR. Study Design and Setting We systematically reviewed evidence of the impact of increased fluid intake, on urinary tract infection (UTI) recurrence, in individuals at risk for UTIs. The review was conducted by experienced systematic reviewers with complementary skills (two researcher clinicians, an information specialist, and an epidemiologist), using Systematic Review Automation tools, and blocked off time for the duration of the project. The outcomes were time to complete the SR, time to complete individual SR tasks, facilitators and barriers to progress, and peer reviewer feedback on the SR manuscript. Times to completion were analyzed quantitatively (minutes and calendar days); facilitators and barriers were mapped onto the Theoretical Domains Framework; and peer reviewer feedback was analyzed quantitatively and narratively. Results The SR was completed in 61 person-hours (9 workdays; 12 calendar days); accepted version of the manuscript required 71 person-hours. Individual SR tasks ranged from 16 person-minutes (deduplication of search results) to 461 person-minutes (data extraction). The least time-consuming SR tasks were obtaining full-texts, searches, citation analysis, data synthesis, and deduplication. The most time-consuming tasks were data extraction, write-up, abstract screening, full-text screening, and risk of bias. Facilitators and barriers mapped onto the following domains: knowledge; skills; memory, attention, and decision process; environmental context and resources; and technology and infrastructure. Two sets of peer reviewer feedback were received on the manuscript: the first included 34 comments requesting changes, 17 changes were made, requiring 173 person-minutes; the second requested 13 changes, and eight were made, requiring 121 person-minutes. Conclusion A small and experienced systematic reviewer team using Systematic Review Automation tools who have protected time to focus solely on the SR can complete a moderately sized SR in 2~weeks.},

We found that originally vibrant communities in terms of consumer amenities benefit more than non-vibrant ones in terms of the attraction of new restaurants and shops. Further, we look into which accessibility destinations promoted by the subway expansion (e.g., accessibility to high-skill jobs or to affluents neighborhoods) result in the most significant effects. We show evidence that agglomeration economies are a relevant location driver mechanism that mediates the impact of accessibility improvements on the attraction of consumption activities. We also found to be evident that purchasing power of both workers and households matters as a market-access amenities location driver. Intra-city spatial concentration of economic activities, including consumption affairs, has been recognized as a longstanding urban phenomenon with implications on different dimensions within the urban planning domain. We discuss how much subway expansion increase or decrease such a spatial disparity of urban opportunities within the urban space.},

This paper seeks to tie the concepts of accessibility and agglomeration together by arguing that accessibility benefits ultimately stem from the agglomerative potential created by various transportation investments. This line of reasoning provides an avenue to use the economic mechanisms described in agglomeration theory to analyze the effects of specific transportation modes. To do this, the paper traces the literature on the economic impacts of transportation systems and presents a theoretical framework for understanding the connection between specific transportation modes and specific agglomeration benefits. Ultimately, specific modes have unique features that are more or less conducive to specific agglomeration benefits, to which specific types of businesses also respond. These specific connections are particularly important to understand as the development of new urban transportation modes, for example, autonomous vehicles—and their potential economic impacts—increases rapidly.},

Thus, this article develops an approach for constructing spatially explicit random forest models by including spatially lagged variables to mirror various spatial econometric specifications in order to test their comparative performance against traditional spatial and nonspatial regression models for predicting block‐level employment density around new transit stations in Los Angeles. This article employs a “post hoc” testing approach to isolate the impact of a particular variable (transit proximity)—and supplemental diagnostics (such as partial dependence plots and permutation importances)—to help inform explanatory relationships. The results indicate that random forest models slightly outperform spatial econometric models, and the inclusion of spatial lag parameters modestly improves random forest model accuracy—the best‐fit spatial random forest model demonstrates 84.61\% accuracy in predicting post‐construction employment density around newly built transit stations, compared to 81.88\% for the best‐fit spatial econometric model and 84.37\% for the nonspatial random forest model. However, given these somewhat small differences, it is not possible to conclude that the random forest approach is clearly superior to traditional spatial econometric models from these results alone.},

Findings show that the transit adjacency is worth an 88\% increase in knowledge sector new starts, a 40\% increase in service sector new starts and a 28\% increase in retail new starts at the time the system opened, when compared with automobile-accessible control areas. However, the light rail also appears to suffer from a ‘novelty factor’– after the initial increase in new establishment activity in adjacent block groups, the effect diminishes at the rate of 8\%, 6\% and 7\% per year, respectively. The results also provide insight into the spatial extent of light rail impacts to new business formation, with areas 1 mile from stations observing 21\% fewer retail new business starts and 12\% fewer knowledge sector new starts than areas within a quarter of a mile of stations.},

  abstract = {In the planning of a new passenger railway in Perth over many years, state agencies have actively pursued opportunities for transit-oriented development along its route. There is a strong policy framework demonstrating clear intent on the type of development required. Designing a transport system to compete with the car in an established low-density suburban environment has, however, raised some significant challenges for land-use planning. This article reports the results of research aimed at assessing changes in non-residential land use and the behavioural responses of local businesses in three emerging transit-oriented development precincts. It examines the first wave surveys of land use and businesses in 2006, the year before the railway opened, questioning the extent to which business has anticipated the new railway. The findings indicate that, despite good policy intent, planning in anticipation of the railway has been weak and insufficient attention was paid to implementation of important strategic planning principles and policies. While some land uses are compatible with transit-oriented development, these businesses employ small numbers, at odds with policies that required high trip generating development. Businesses have not shown a particularly strong interest in the new railway, their location decisions appear to reflect standard business practice rather than being influenced by opportunities created by the railway. There is a glimmer of anticipation—incoming businesses are more positive about the opportunities the railway may bring than those established in the station precincts before the 2001 railway route was announced. In particular, a significantly higher proportion of businesses in one case study station precinct are positive about opportunities created by the railway.},

By analysing the metropolitan scale in its economic, spatial and political dimensions, it has been possible to detect both similar and different kinds and degrees of development, and to focus on their determinants. Evidence of processes conducive to the construction of metropolitan scales in economic, spatial, political and discursive terms corresponds to rather weak and contentious policy agendas. There is no evidence of a direct correlation between the urban challenges brought about by globalization and the construction of metropolitan scales as the prevailing political solution. Where they do exist, the policies through which the metropolitan scale are constructed may have different goals and forms, depending on place-specific circumstances. If global forces play a role in the construction of urban/metropolitan spaces, this is mediated by local and national factors of an economic, political and cultural nature.},

At the same time, little is known about the importance of agglomeration economies for the actual location behavior of firms. This is remarkable, since theories that underlie agglomeration economies are microeconomic in nature. In a case study of the Dutch province of South Holland, we analyze micro-level data to determine the extent to which relocation decisions are dependent on accessibility and agglomeration externalities when controlling for firm characteristics. These externalities are measured with location attributes for both own-sector localization and urbanization economies and for proximity to transport infrastructures. The results confirm that firm relocation behavior is affected much more by firm-level attributes (size, age, and growth rate) than by agglomeration and accessibility attributes. Still, accessibility and agglomeration are significantly attached to firm relocations, though their effects vary over sectors. Own-sector and generalized external economies are more important for a firm's location choices than proximity to transport infrastructure.},

Next the added value of incorporating such effects in urban simulation models is tested with two series of validation runs with a microscopic model for firm dynamics. The presented Spatial Firm-demographic Micro-simulation (SFM) model simulates transitions and events in the firm population, including firm relocations, firm growth, firm dissolution and firm formation. Accessibility is measured with proximity to infrastructure access points and logsums of business and commuting trips from a transport model. Agglomeration measures are based on theories from urban economics and integrate travel time range bands into measures for specialisation and diversification. Estimation results confirm a significant influence of accessibility and agglomeration on the choice behaviour of firms. Application of these measures prove to increase the validity of the firm-demographic simulation model to a significant but modest extend.},

In this study, we examine how investments in urban rail transit affect clusters of consumer amenities in China, based on the experiences of six Chinese cities that are at varying stages of rail transit development. A difference-in-differences model is built using geocoded data on wide categories of consumer amenities to estimate the rail transit effects from a sample of 315 new rail transit stations opened between 2015 and 2018. Our results show that the opening of a new station induces an increase of approximately 4\% in the total number of consumer amenities in the vicinity of the station within the first year. The impact strengthens substantially after two years. The effect of rail transit varies across cities and among different neighborhoods within a city. In most cities, rail transit effects are stronger in central areas, contributing to agglomeration of retail and dining amenities. When the rail system expands rapidly, however, the opening of a new station tiggers greater growth of daily service amenities in the suburbs, leading to a decentralization effect. Additionally, we find that neighborhood purchasing power and transit-adjacent land supply have limited impacts on amenity growth driven by new rail stations. This study provides important insight into how public amenities interact with private amenities and its findings have significant implications for urban planners and policymakers.},

  abstract = {The housing affordability issue in mega-cities creates a significant job-housing mismatch and undermines productive new business creation. This paper focuses on Beijing and investigates whether improved accessibility via the subway network helps new firms benefit from agglomeration economies and, at the same time, provides workers with easy access the low-cost rental housing. Using commercial rental housing transaction records and dynamic bilateral subway travel time from 2010-2015, we build the measure of the accessibility to business clusters and low-cost rental housing through the subway network at a high spatial resolution. Taking advantage of exogenous shocks from the network reconfiguration due to the rapid subway expansion in Beijing, we employ a matched difference-in-differences estimation in multiple periods to identify the causal elasticity estimate of the new firm formation with respect to the accessibility to business clusters and low-cost rental housing. We demonstrate that the subway network is more conducive to firm establishments. The effects are more salient for firms in skill-intensive sectors. New skill-intensive firms increase by 0.44\% given a 1\% increase in the accessibility to business clusters. The elasticity of new skill-intensive firms with respect to the accessibility to low-cost rental housing is about 0.74. Our findings that transit-oriented development leads to a higher concentration of new skill-intensive businesses, pointing to the importance of an efficient public transit system capable of serving the dispersed workforce and improving the efficiency of firm location choice.},

Although much research has investigated physical neighborhood changes and neighborhood demographic changes driven by transit projects, little is known about the perceived effects of transit projects in business communities. In a direct response to this knowledge gap, a random-sampled survey of 160 businesses was conducted along four existing and planned transit corridors in the Twin Cities region in Minnesota. With the survey responses, ordered logistic regression models of business perceptions of transit corridor projects were estimated. It was found that responding businesses generally expect positive effects from transit corridors in the future, but the likelihood of positive perceptions differs significantly according to business location, size, and sector, as well as employees’ and customers’ demographics and customers’ travel behavior. These findings provide insights into the types of businesses to target for special outreach efforts as well as strategies for mitigating negative effects and maximizing positive effects perceived by station area businesses.},

This paper examines Beijing, whose services account for more than 80~\% of GDP, to ascertain whether enhanced accessibility through the expansion of subway network facilitates new service enterprises to capitalize on agglomeration economies, ultimately contributing to the transformation of the urban landscape. Using a matched dataset comprising 16,571 gird cells, each measuring 1~×~1~km in size, and information on newly registered service enterprises in Beijing from 2007 to 2018, we employ a mult-period difference-in-difference (DID) estimation methodology, leveraging exogenous shocks from the opening of new subway lines, to examine the causal relationship between subway openings and the location decision of service enterprises. Our findings indicate that the subway network positively influences the establishment of service enterprises, with a 53.8~\% increase in newly registered service enterprises following the opening of a new subway line. Furthermore, the agglomeration effects of subway network are more salient for newly registered producer service enterprises, which tend to cluster in central areas, whereas consumer service enterprises demonstrate a preference for agglomeration in the city's periphery, thereby contributing to the reconfiguration of the city's urban structure.},

  abstract = {Despite the hundreds of billions of dollars being spent on infrastructure development – from roads, rail and airports to energy extraction and power networks to the Internet – surprisingly little reliable knowledge exists about the performance of these investments in terms of actual costs, benefits and risks. This paper presents results from the first statistically significant study of cost performance in transport infrastructure projects. The sample used is the largest of its kind, covering 258 projects in 20 nations worth approximately US\$90 billion (constant 1995 prices). The paper shows with overwhelming statistical significance that in terms of costs transport infrastructure projects do not perform as promised. The conclusion is tested for different project types, different geographical regions and different historical periods. Substantial cost escalation is the rule rather than the exception. For rail, average cost escalation is 45\% (SD=38), for fixed links (tunnels and bridges) it is 34\% (62) and for roads 20\% (30). Cost escalation appears a global phenomenon, existing across 20 nations on five continents. Cost estimates have not improved and cost escalation not decreased over the past 70 years. Cost estimates used in decision-making for transport infrastructure development are highly, systematically and significantly misleading. Large cost escalations combined with large standard deviations translate into large financial risks. However, such risks are typically ignored or underplayed in decision-making, to the detriment of social and economic welfare.},

In order to make proper causal inference, we rely on historical instruments and control for all other transportation modes that could be complement or substitute to the RER. Our results show that proximity to an RER station increases employment and population density and, in particular, employment and population growth. The latter effects are higher in municipalities located near RER stations and close to employment (sub)centers. They are also found to be particularly strong for jobs in the service sector, for factory workers, and for highly educated population. We find no impact of the RER expansion on employment growth during the first part of the period, while the effect on population growth appears earlier but declines over time.},

Yet, very little has been said on how these improvements affect the spatial organization of the economic activity in the suburbs. This paper analyses the effects of transportation's changes on employment subcenters formation. Using data from metropolitan Paris between 1968 and 2010, we first show that the spatial pattern of job decentralization is reinforcing the polycentric nature of Paris: the number of subcenters grew from 21 in 1968 to 35 in 2010 and the employment growth was very intense within them. Second, our main contribution is to show that the new rail transit clearly affects the emergence of subcenters: not only does the presence of a rail station increase the probability of a suburban municipality of becoming (part of) a subcenter by 5 to 10\%, but a 10\% increase in municipality proximity to a suburban station is found to increase its chance to be part of a subcenter by 3 to 5\%.},

Accessibility measures are reviewed using a broad range of relevant criteria, including theoretical basis, interpretability and communicability, and data requirements of the measures. Accessibility impacts of land-use and transport strategies are often evaluated using accessibility measures, which researchers and policy makers can easily operationalise and interpret, such as travelling speed, but which generally do not satisfy theoretical criteria. More complex and disaggregated accessibility measures, however, increase complexity and the effort for calculations and the difficulty of interpretation. The current practice can be much improved by operationalising more advanced location-based and utility-based accessibility measures that are still relatively easy to interpret for researchers and policy makers, and can be computed with state-of-the-practice data and/or land-use and transport models. Research directions towards theoretically more advanced accessibility measures point towards the inclusion of individual's spatial–temporal constraints and feedback mechanisms between accessibility, land-use and travel behaviour. Furthermore, there is a need for theoretical and empirical research on relationships between accessibility, option values and non-user benefits, and the measurement of different components of accessibility.},

Moreover, technological change has eliminated the importance of fixed infrastructure transport (rail and water) that played a critical role in creating natural urban centres. In this article, we document this decline and explore several simple implications of a world where it is essentially free to move goods, but expensive to move people.

Typical challenges encountered in identifying cause–effect relationships in applied transportation research are analysed via case study simulations, and R code to execute and adapt causal estimators is made available. Causal inference can be used to obtain unbiased and consistent estimates of causal effects in non-experimental settings when interventions or exposures are non-randomly assigned. The paper argues that empirical analyses in transport research are typically conducted in this setting, and consequently, that causal inference has immediate and valuable applicability.},

This is of particular concern when reviews address policy- and practice-relevant questions. Systematic reviews have been introduced as a more rigorous approach to synthesizing evidence across studies; they rely on a suite of evidence-based methods aimed at maximizing rigour and minimizing susceptibility to bias. Despite the increasing popularity of systematic reviews in the environmental field, evidence synthesis methods continue to be poorly applied in practice, resulting in the publication of syntheses that are highly susceptible to bias. Recognizing the constraints that researchers can sometimes feel when attempting to plan, conduct and publish rigorous and comprehensive evidence syntheses, we aim here to identify major pitfalls in the conduct and reporting of systematic reviews, making use of recent examples from across the field. Adopting a ‘critical friend’ role in supporting would-be systematic reviews and avoiding individual responses to police use of the ‘systematic review’ label, we go on to identify methodological solutions to mitigate these pitfalls. We then highlight existing support available to avoid these issues and call on the entire community, including systematic review specialists, to work towards better evidence syntheses for better evidence and better decisions.},

  abstract = {Scientists are increasingly overwhelmed by the volume of articles being published. The total number of articles indexed in Scopus and Web of Science has grown exponentially in recent years; in 2022 the article total was ∼47\% higher than in 2016, which has outpaced the limited growth—if any—in the number of practicing scientists. Thus, publication workload per scientist has increased dramatically. We define this problem as “the strain on scientific publishing.” To analyze this strain, we present five data-driven metrics showing publisher growth, processing times, and citation behaviors. We draw these data from web scrapes, and from publishers through their websites or upon request. Specific groups have disproportionately grown in their articles published per year, contributing to this strain. Some publishers enabled this growth by hosting “special issues” with reduced turnaround times. Given pressures on researchers to “publish or perish” to compete for funding, this strain was likely amplified by these offers to publish more articles. We also observed widespread year-over-year inflation of journal impact factors coinciding with this strain, which risks confusing quality signals. Such exponential growth cannot be sustained. The metrics we define here should enable this evolving conversation to reach actionable solutions to address the strain on scientific publishing.},

The approach combines the behavioural richness of an integrated transport and location choice modelling system (TRESIS) and its outputs to a spatial computable general equilibrium model (SGEM), which uses data at a more aggregate level to compute the additional impacts of transport infrastructure change on the wider economy. This has allowed the development of an integrated transport–location–economy-wide model system known as TRESIS–SGEM. The model system is applied to the introduction of the North-West Rail Link project in Sydney, Australia to illustrate the capability of TRESIS–SGEM, identifying a 17.6\% markup over the conventional transport user benefit.},

The most prominent voice on these issues is typically from the project promoter, reflecting their position of power in the decision-making process, but there are other voices to be understood, including varied views from the local community. This paper uses Q methodology to develop discourses associated with the proposed High Speed Two project and redevelopment of Euston station and the surrounding neighbourhoods. 28 in-depth surveys are used with local residents, local employees, politicians, local government officers and academics, covering attitudes to the proposed Euston redevelopment. The Q method analysis highlights three major discourses: the ‘Community Activist’, the ‘Rail Promoter’, and the ‘Optimistic Practitioner’. Understanding these different discourses, and their components, is important for decision-makers in ensuring that investment strategies can better reflect the different viewpoints evident in the public domain. Ultimately, this can help to improve the social consequences of transport investment.},

Such mechanisms can lead to increases of output and productivity and create firm-level benefits beyond the direct transport user benefits considered in traditional project evaluation. Transport project evaluation and transport policy more in general require an understanding of these micro-level transmission mechanisms to correctly guide investment decisions regarding the location and type of future transport projects.},

There is a paucity of literature examining the relationship between rail stations and firm locations by industry at the transit station level.

This study examines the National Establishment Time Series (NETS) dataset for Washington, DC and its suburbs in Maryland, which contains longitudinal and cross-sectional firm-level data and firm-level relocation data for the years 1990–2010. This study contributes to the literature on the effect of transit investment and TOD on economic development by suggesting future research agendas based on the descriptive analysis results, particularly addressing the question of net effects for locations beyond the immediate station area.},

Cities, she asserts, are not the result of processes most scientists and economists have assumed they were: Cities do not develop because a pre-existing rural economic base develops and eventually becomes strong enough to support an essentially parasitic urban growth. Instead, Jacobs argues, cities are the prerequisite for any kind of rural economy. Where there are no cities, there are no sustainable rural economies, and the rural economy depends on the city rather than the other way around. Jacobs defines "city" as a "settlement that consistently generates its economic growth from its own local economy"; population centers of any size that have never done this do not meet her definition of city. Likewise, Jacob defines "urban" as "pertaining only to cities ..."--Review from http://classes.seattleu.edu/multidisciplinary/urbanstudies/resource/reviews/economy.htm (Oct. 18, 2012).},

Second, if so, we examine whether it contributes to the suburbanisation of population and employment or spatial concentration around the urban centre. To do so, we focus on the improvement of the subway system in Seoul metropolitan areas between 2000 and 2010 with micro population and employment data. Because of the interrelationship between population, employment and transportation, we control for the interplay between population, employment and subway network by using a simultaneous equation model. Our results provide several interesting findings. First, the improvement of the subway system plays an important role in changes in urban spatial structure. Second, the improvement of the subway system significantly affects job growth in the urban centre and subcentres in the city of Seoul. Third, the interrelationship between population, employment and public transportation generates redistributive effects that are substantially associated with urban growth and decline, and determine urban spatial structure.},

A spatial-lag model and a spatial-error model, in addition to an ordinary least square model under the framework of the DID approach, are employed in the empirical analyses. The results show that investment in urban railway lines was in areas with lower population densities and higher employment densities. The urban railway investment significantly positively influenced land price but insignificantly influenced population and employment densities. Land price was positively influenced by population and employment densities. The analysis suggests that introduction of the railway directly affected the land price via anticipation of expected future development, rather than an indirect effect via increased population and employment densities. Finally, the policy implications regarding transit-oriented development are discussed, including strategic residential development in line with the railway investment and the integrated development of business clusters following railway investment to enhance the economic effects of railway investments.},

Many urban economists and planners argue that convenient public transit is one of the core urban strategies to attract and retain creative industries and increase employment density. Although many leaders of cities in the world pay attention to the new type of public transit, we have less understanding of the BRT impact on the location choice of creative industries and job density. Through multilevel modeling, this study tests whether BRT improvement in Seoul, Korea was appealing to the spatial patterns of creative industries and if it changed the spatial variation of employment density. This study confirms that the BRT system is the favorable component for the location of creative industries and service sectors within 500 meters of BRT-bus stops. In addition, the BRT operation increases the employment density within the same distance to the bus stops by 54\%. The key findings suggest that enhancing the public transit system would be an effective strategy for higher competitiveness in the urban economy and compact urban structure.},

  abstract = {Inter-urban transportation railway becomes the chosen mass transportation mode by the people for daily commuting. The tariff is relatively cheaper and affordable. The travel times are shorter as compared to other modes of transportation. This study aimed to understand the development surrounding Jakarta – Bogor Inter-urban transportation railway station - Cilebut Station located in Sukaraja District. Correlation between passengers and population is 0.99 that shows great impacts to development area surrounding it. Analysis of development aspects are land use, population, and economic change. Using Geographic Information System analysis from the year 2010 to 2015, residential area increased by 18.11\% and plantation area decreased by 32.9\%. Population was analyzed using average rate of growth from the year 2011 to 2015, the result is 4.6\%. Population density increased from 3809 people/sq.km to 4694 people/sq.km. Facilities of industry and grocery store increased, likewise labor structure of business and hotel increased by 11350 persons and services by 3460 persons. But agriculture labor decreased by 894 persons. Based on this research, local government should be alerted. In the case a region has a railway station and is stopped-by inter-urban transportation trains, the area development will take place rapidly, intervention needs to be done.},

This paper provides a systematic review of recent empirical evidence from the USA, Europe and East Asia, classified regarding the type of transport infrastructure (road or rail), LU indicator (land cover, population or employment density, development type) and outcome (significance, relationship’s direction) as well as influential exogenous factors. Proximity to the rail network is generally associated with population growth (particularly soon after the development of railway infrastructure), conversion to residential uses and the development of higher residential densities. Meanwhile, proximity to the road network is frequently associated with increases in employment densities as well as the conversion of land to a variety of urban uses including commercial and industrial development. Compared with road infrastructure, the impact of rail infrastructure is often less significant for land cover or population and employment density change. The extent of TINs’ impact on LU over time can be explained by the saturation in TIN-related accessibility and LU development.},

  abstract = {This research examines the association that intercity passenger rails have with population and employment growth at the county level in the continental United States from 2000 to 2010. This research adopts an integrated spatial regression approach that incorporates both spatial lag and spatial error dependence. The data come from the US Census Bureau, the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, the Land Developability Index, and the National Atlas of the United States. Population change and employment change are regressed on intercity passenger rails, controlling for 14 socioeconomic variables. Intercity passenger rails are measured by the number of intercity passenger rail terminals in each county. The results suggest that the associations that intercity passenger rails have with population and employment change are both direct and indirect. Intercity passenger rails have a negative and direct association with population and employment change from 2000 to 2010. The Great Recession during this period may have compelled people to move out of their home county in search of jobs; having intercity passenger rails facilitated this process. The results also indicate that intercity passenger rails have a positive and indirect association with population and employment change. Population change and employment change in one county affect population and employment in adjacent counties. This indirect association shows the spatial spillover effect of population and employment growth through passenger rails. The indirect association does not come from within the county; rather, it is a disperse effect from neighbors. This research suggests that intercity passenger rails, although built long ago, still play an important role in facilitating the spread of change and the integration of local communities into a larger regional economy.

However, few studies have tried to understand how public transit affects employment changes in a community while accounting for housing costs at the same time. As an update to and methodological advance on early studies, this study aims to measure light rail transit (LRT) systems’ impacts on the change in labor participation and housing affordability. This study uses the decennial Census and 5-year American Community Survey (ACS) data at the block group level and conducts propensity score matching in 12 selected LRT systems across the U.S. opened between 2000 and 2010. By comparing growth rates of the average weeks worked and the median gross rent between treatment and control groups, the results show that an introduction of an LRT station increases the average weeks worked—a measure of labor participation—while not raising the median gross rent. Further analysis also shows that the increased average weeks worked after operation of LRT systems is a result of an increase in the percentage of full-time and year-round workers and a decrease in the proportion of part-time and part-year workers. Ultimately, the findings provide planners and policymakers with a better understanding of the effects of LRT systems on the economic stability of urban communities.},

Urban light rail investment can help regenerate Central Business Districts and boost employment and property prices. Similar rail investments in different locations may not however have the same economic impacts — geography matters.

Even though they are seen as the “gold standard” when synthesising primary research, systematic reviews and maps are typically resource-intensive and complex activities. Thus, managing the conduct and reporting of such reviews can become a time consuming and challenging task. This paper introduces the open access online tool CADIMA, which was developed through a collaboration between the Julius Kühn-Institut and the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence, in order to increase the efficiency of the evidence synthesis process and facilitate reporting of all activities to maximise methodological rigour. Furthermore, we analyse how CADIMA compares with other available tools by providing a comprehensive summary of existing software designed for the purposes of systematic review management. We show that CADIMA is the only available open access tool that is designed to: (1) assist throughout the systematic review/map process; (2) be suited to reviews broader than medical sciences; (3) allow for offline data extraction; and, (4) support working as a review team.},

  abstract = {The case for major transport investment is frequently made in terms of impact on economic performance. A recurring difficulty however faced by policy makers is a disjoint between this motivation and the cost benefit analysis, which may be too narrow. Broadening the set of economic mechanisms studied creates the risk that bad arguments are legitimised and effects can be exaggerated. There is a need for an appraisal framework that ensures all relevant impacts are captured, ensures the opportunity cost of drawing more resources into an activity is identified and meets the needs of the different audiences of the appraisal. There is a need for context specific appraisal. Central to the impact on economic performance is how private sector investment responds to changes in accessibility. Investment in one location can improve productivity, create growth, but may also displace output and employment. Thus we group impacts within the framework into four types: user benefits, proximity and productivity effects, investment and land use impacts and employment effects. Within each of these groups there are a series of transport-economy mechanisms which become relevant in different contexts. Some of these mechanisms are well established and are applied in practice. Others still are more challenging and need to be the subject of further research. Throughout improvements in the evidence base are needed.},

This lack of attention is in part related to theoretical inadequacies and methodological difficulties, not least the separating out and attribution of effects. Such issues were addressed by a major empirical study conducted in Sheffield during the early 1990s. This paper outlines the research methods adopted, which involved breaking down impacts into five thematic areas (image; property; land use; business location and operations; and labour market), and exploring the different mechanisms whereby effects might have become apparent in each. The findings from each of the themes are briefly summarised, the overall conclusion being that, in current circumstances, the impact of transport investment on regeneration is not particularly strong. In a broader policy context, however, the study also pointed to the improbability of securing regeneration benefits from transport infrastructure, given the lack of co-ordination and integration between the two policy areas, and the increasingly fragmented nature of urban governance in general.},

  abstract = {This study explores differences in the effects of rail transit investment across various types of lands with different values and locations, using the development of Seoul Metro Line 9 (SML9) in Korea as a case. Seoul Metro Line 9′s proximity, neighbourhood and wider economic effects are assessed. A spatial autoregressive difference-in-difference (SAR-DID) model is developed to control for the issue of spatial autocorrelation, together with a standard difference-in-difference model and a quantile regression model. The findings of these analyses are as follows. First, office and apartment lands received the largest proximity and wider economic benefits from SML9 development in their respective category. Second, SML9′s neighbourhood effects are larger for lands that increased their business and development opportunities due to the opening of SML9, such as retail and low-rise multi-family house lands. Third, the proximity and wider economic effects of rail transit investment and its neighbourhood effect generally increase with proximity to a rail station. Finally, residential and commercial lands at low price levels received fewer benefits from the completion of SML9 than those at the upper price levels. These differences are related to the various factors presented in this paper, such as the amount of capital accumulated on the lands, the number of users of the network on the lands and the different nature of each type of residential and commercial land. Based on the improved understanding of the relationship between the effects of rail transit investment and land characteristics, a well-organised land use plan for new rail transit projects can be formulated. An important implication for policymakers is that a well-organised land use plan can not only regulate land uses in the area of rail stations, but is also one of key tools to promote successful rail transit projects in urban areas.},

Our findings highlight URT's positive spillover effects, promoting both geographic and demographic economic agglomeration. Nevertheless, it is imperative to note that URT's capacity to ameliorate economic conditions remains constrained in cities with sluggish or stagnant development.},

The empirical results show the following: (1) the construction of urban rail transit infrastructure has a significant positive effect on the agglomeration of the labor force, capital, and technological innovation; (2) urban rail transit construction effectively induces agglomeration in the urban manufacturing industry and consumer service industry; and (3) the impact of urban rail transit construction on agglomeration in the urban manufacturing industry and consumer services industry is primarily due to the intermediary effects of factor agglomeration. The results show that gradually improving the urban rail transit network, strengthening the construction of comprehensive rail transit hubs, and optimizing capital allocation within urban rail transit allow for the full utilization of urban rail transit construction in promoting industrial agglomeration.},

  abstract = {This study explores the relationship between newly launched metro stations and commercial gentrification. It focuses on gentrifiable areas near five metro stations in Neihu District, Taipei City, Taiwan. Changes in retailers and restaurants located in the study areas from 2009 to 2015 were observed using logit models to analyze the image records of Google Maps Street View. Empirical evidence revealed that the probability of commercial gentrification increases as the travel distance from metro stations decreases. In addition, the influence ranges of commercial gentrification are approximately 240\,m for short-term changes (2009–2012) and 300\,m for long-term changes (2009–2015). The influence ranges also vary with the land uses of the station areas. Accordingly, this research suggests that local administrations should take commercial gentrification into account when developing metro systems.},

  abstract = {The emergence of Light Rail Transit systems (LRTs) could exert considerable impacts on sustainable urban development. It is crucial to predict the potential land use changes since LRTs are being increasingly built throughout the world. While various land use and land cover change (LUCC) models have been developed during the past two decades, the basic assumption for LUCC prediction is the continuation of present trends in land use development. It is therefore unreasonable to predict potential urban land use changes associated with LRTs simply based on earlier trends because the impacts of LRT investment may vary greatly over time. To tackle this challenge, our study aims to share the experiences from previous lines with newly planned lines. Dongguan, whose government decided to build LRTs around 2008, was selected as the study area. First, we assessed the impacts of this city’s first LRT (Line R2) on three urban land use types (i.e., industrial development, commercial and residential development, and rural development) at different periods. The results indicate that Line R2 exerted a negative impact on industrial development and rural development, but a positive impact on commercial and residential development during the planning stage of this line. Second, such spatial impacts (the consequent land use changes) during this stage were simulated by using artificial neural network cellular automata. More importantly, we further predicted the potential impacts of Line R1, which is assumed to be a newly planned line, based on the above calibrated model and a traditional method respectively. The comparisons between them demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which can easily take advantage of the experiences from other LRTs. The proposed method is expected to provide technical support for sustainable urban and transportation planning.},

Urban rail projects can increase accessibility and foot traffic, benefiting nearby businesses, but may also lead to higher rents and commercial gentrification, potentially displacing small or local businesses. However, little is known about how transit investments affect business survival over time. To address this gap, we employ a quasi-experimental design and estimate Extended Cox Hazards models using historical business microdata from Data Axle, covering a 21-year period from 1998 to 2019. Our analysis compares businesses located within 0.5 miles of light rail stations with those in a carefully selected control area, while also examining heterogeneous impacts by distance to stations and by TOD district characteristics. Our empirical application focuses on the LYNX Blue Line in Charlotte, NC. Our findings indicate that the effects of light rail on business survival are sector-specific. Specialty retailers (NAICS code 45) located between 0.125 and 0.25 miles from a station experience a 58\% reduction in closure risk five to ten years after the beginning of light rail operation. Accommodation and food services (NAICS code 72) located between 0.25 and 0.5 miles from stations experience decreases of 66\% in the probability of closure during the same time period. Moreover, service establishments and specialty retailers operating in TOD zones exhibit reductions in closure risk of approximately 50\% compared to their counterparts in the control group. Our results demonstrate that overall, proximity to transit and TOD environments that encourage pedestrian traffic through parking restrictions and higher development density do not negatively impact retail and service establishments and in some cases significantly support the longevity of businesses. However, more research is needed to improve our understanding of transit’s impacts on nearby businesses and to design relevant and effective policies.},

  abstract = {A plethora of studies has explored the relationship between transit investments and property prices, but very little is known about how new transit projects and transit-oriented development affect nearby businesses and whether they contribute to commercial gentrification. This research presents a quasi-experimental econometric framework for studying transit-induced commercial gentrification from project announcement to post operation using business microdata. Previous urban economics and planning research informs the identification of retail and service business categories associated with the phenomenon of commercial gentrification, including local businesses, chain stores, and businesses offering non-essential or upscale products. Negative binomial models with a difference-in-differences specification enable the temporal and spatiotemporal analysis of business entries, exits, and turnover and the estimation of transit-induced impacts. The developed methodology is demonstrated through an empirical example: the study of the effects of the LYNX Blue light rail line in Charlotte, NC, over a 20-year period. Our study makes a significant contribution to the limited quantitative research on transit and commercial gentrification and is the first to focus on the causal relationship between the two. The application of the analysis framework to other metropolitan areas with transit systems in the future will inform transportation and urban planners on the type of businesses that could be primarily affected and the timing and extent of these effects, and help them design effective and targeted business assistance programs.},

We apply a difference-in-differences method to a particular subsample, selected to minimize the endogeneity that is routinely found in the evaluation of the effects of transport infrastructure. We find that the RER opening caused a 8.8\% rise in employment in the municipalities connected to the network between 1975 and 1990. While we find no effect on overall population growth, our results suggest that the arrival of the RER may have increased competition for land, since high-skilled households were more likely to locate in the vicinity of a RER station.},

The case study is the municipality of Alcorcon, which is served by the new metro line since 2003. Specifically, we explore the location patterns by different industry sectors, to evaluate if the new metro line has encouraged the emergence of a "Metrosur spatial economy". Our results indicate that the pattern of economic activity location is related to urban accessibility and that agglomeration, through economies of scale, also plays an important role.

Therefore, when neighborhoods undergo meaningful economic and social changes, such as those that take place under gentrification, one would expect local businesses to feel the effects. Is gentrification, however, a threat or a boon for existing businesses? What are the implications for the residents who patronize these services? I test these questions here, using microdata on properties and businesses in New York City. I also drill down to three illustrative case neighborhoods, which reveal nuance beyond the average citywide effects. The results are mixed and show that gentrification is associated with both business retention and disruption. I find that most businesses stay in place, and displacement is no more prevalent in the typical gentrifying neighborhood than in nongentrifying neighborhoods. When businesses do leave gentrifying neighborhoods, however, the spaces tend to sit vacant for relatively longer periods of time than they do in nongentrifying neighborhoods. Gentrifying neighborhoods are more likely to attract new types of services than are nongentrifying and higher-income neighborhoods, and they more often attract multiple-establishment businesses (chains) to replace displaced businesses. As the neighborhood drill-downs show, however, cases still exist in which neighborhoods undergoing gentrification lose businesses without the upside of new amenities.},

Foremost is the belief that decentralization, or suburbanization, lies at the root of most of the social problems that plague urban areas. Therefore, an understanding of the process is basic to policies and programs for mitigating such ills. Professor Mills thus presents an empirical study of the patterns and causes of suburbanization of population and employment from the 1880's to the 1960's. He then constructs theoretical models to analyze the relation between the locations of employment and residence in urban areas as well as the reasons for the increasing move to the suburbs. Special attention is paid to congestion as a cause and effect of the trend towards suburbanization. After considering an idealized model with an economically efficient transportation system, he concludes that a policy of efficient investment and pricing in urban transportation might have a significant effect on the pattern of urban residential density. Finally, a discussion is presented of the ways in which the models could be modified and extended for use in public policy analysis. (BL)},

While there are many studies which examine the effect of a new urban public transport system on the values of neighbouring properties, the number of researches which focus on the identification of the benefits that businesses can expect is rather limited. The objective of the present paper is to identify parameters which have a significant impact on the business revenue, as well as to quantify that impact, focusing on the city of Thessaloniki, Greece, where a metro system is under construction A questionnaire-based survey took place, addressed to business enterprise owners and professionals in the surrounding area of ten of the planned locations of Thessaloniki metro stations. The data collected by this survey were reinforced with additional attributes of the businesses, such as their distance from the nearest metro station, and a statistical analysis has been conducted, utilizing also regression modelling techniques The results indicate that more benefits can be expected for businesses which are located closer to the metro stations, especially in areas with limited parking availability. The benefits are estimated to be higher for the land use category that includes restaurants/café/bars. Models of that type can be very useful in cases of implementing alternative funding/financing methods, such as Value Capture. For the implementation of such methods it is very important to accurately estimate the benefits that all the parties involved in an investment will gain.},

  abstract = {The impacts of transit improvements on agglomeration economies have been studied repeatedly in regional science and urban planning. However, none of the studies focus specifically on the effect agglomeration associated with transit has on socially and economically disadvantaged groups. To fill this gap, this study primarily sheds light on the issue of low-skilled labor force’s opportunities related to transit-induced economic development. More specifically, we investigate the heterogeneous impacts of transit-induced agglomeration on job opportunities for employees with different skill levels and in different service sectors in Philadelphia, PA. For this study, we chose Location Quotients (LQ) to measure first skill- and then industry-specific agglomeration. We estimate spatial econometric models to analyze direct and spillover impacts of transit-induced agglomeration on job opportunities for low- and high-skilled jobs and different industries. Our results show that transit-induced agglomeration has a negative direct effect on low-skilled jobs, and a positive direct effect on high-skilled jobs. These results imply that the economic development revitalization strategy heavily favored high-tech and knowledge-based firms leading to a concentration of high-skilled workers and an underrepresentation of low-skilled workers in the urban core areas. This suggests less accessibility to job opportunities for transit-dependent low-skilled workers. The presence of positive spatial spillover effects of low-skilled workers further indicates that the concentration of economic activities around transit stations absorbs economic resources from neighboring areas. Overall, the revitalization projects have caused uneven and inconsistent local economic conditions across the entire metropolitan area},

This paper examines the case of the Paris region. Based on a logistic regression model using municipal-level employment data (1993–2008), it aims at assessing whether municipalities with small amounts of employment are likely to experience high employment growth depending on their location vis-à-vis transport infrastructures. Motorways are found to have an influence for very small areas and airports for bigger ones. However, the role of transport infrastructures is rather limited when the analysis is differentiated according to economic sectors.},

A simple model of labor supply predicts that access to subway services can decrease transportation costs and improve labor force participation, but has ambiguous effects on the intensive margin of labor market outcomes. Empirical estimates from US cities show that a 10\% expansion in subway miles increases the labor force participation of low-skilled individuals without a car by eight percentage points. However, subway expansions have no significant effect on the labor force participation of low-skilled individuals who own automobiles or on high-skilled workers. In contrast, expansions of light rails and buses have no significant effect on the labor market outcomes of low-skilled individuals. Improved subway services do not affect wages, hours worked, and commuting times, suggesting that the labor market benefits of subways mainly lie in the extensive margin of labor supply.},

SLR, as the name implies, is a systematic way of collecting, critically evaluating, integrating, and presenting findings from across multiple research studies on a research question or topic of interest. SLR provides a way to assess the quality level and magnitude of existing evidence on a question or topic of interest. It offers a broader and more accurate level of understanding than a traditional literature review. A systematic review adheres to standardized methodologies/guidelines in systematic searching, filtering, reviewing, critiquing, interpreting, synthesizing, and reporting of findings from multiple publications on a topic/domain of interest. The Cochrane Collaboration is the most well-known and widely respected global organization producing SLRs within the healthcare field and a standard to follow for any researcher seeking to write a transparent and methodologically sound SLR. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA), like the Cochrane Collaboration, was created by an international network of health-based collaborators and provides the framework for SLR to ensure methodological rigor and quality. The PRISMA statement is an evidence-based guide consisting of a checklist and flowchart intended to be used as tools for authors seeking to write SLR and meta-analyses.},

The findings reveal that the Delhi Metro has significantly increased ridership, providing a comfortable and stress-free travel experience for passengers. It has contributed to economic development by generating employment opportunities and improving the living standards of the local population. The presence of the metro stations has acted as catalysts for urban growth, attracting commercial, and retail establishments. Moreover, the implementation of electric trains and reduced vehicular emissions has led to cleaner and healthier air in the precinct, benefiting residents and commuters. The metro system has also increased green cover by planting trees, developing parks, and creating “green corridors.” Additionally, the Delhi Metro has successfully reduced traffic congestion, making the city more livable.},

  abstract = {Despite a growing body of literature, the relationship between transport investment and regional economic development remains elusive. Individual studies highlight certain aspects but neglect others, and yet do not add up to a holistic framework. This paper engages with this gap by developing a holistic conceptual framework based on the synthesis of the literature. A list of variables and relationships were extracted and classified into a broad framework representing common elements of a regional economic system. Then, a causal loop diagram (CLD) was produced as a conceptual model by employing a system dynamics method that captures the interaction of the elements. The conceptual model reveals that the underlying mechanisms of regional economic development represent a complex and dynamic process engaging multiple factors, causalities, and temporal dynamics. Transport investment improves the attractiveness of regions and generates economic activities, reinforcing further investments, thereby fostering regional GDP and urban growth. The conditions of interregional transport infrastructure determine where cities can emerge and grow, and urban transport infrastructure conditions guide how big (population) and wide (area) a city can become. Three additional soft policies (urban transport, urban policies, and institutions and innovation) influence the attractiveness of regions and their economic activities. The time and scales of the policy inputs may produce different outcomes, i.e., city(ies) size and regional GDP, leading to income inequality across regions. We conclude that the generated conceptual model offers a distinct contribution by originally mapping the links between different studies and provides an overarching framework for further explorations.},

Building on the conceptual framework theoretically discussed in a previous work of the authors, this paper goes beyond current approaches and develops an integrated methodological framework for an ex-ante quantitative assessment of the (direct and indirect) effects of interregional transport infrastructures on spatial economies. To do so, it first applies a brief literature review to the main relevant methodologies, next describes the proposed methodological framework, and finally discusses each framework's component separately. The proposed methodology builds on an input-output (I-O) model conceptualization and contributes to the current literature by (i) integrating direct, indirect, and induced economic impacts; (ii) separating distributive and generative effects for each region; (iii) providing individual estimations based on spatial interdependence or econometric models; (iv) distinguishing cases for trade coefficients’ estimation; (v) investigating the impact on the choice of the location of enterprises' establishment; (vi) assessing the effects of transport infrastructure on tourism; and (vii) incorporating technology “diffusion” from centers to regions. The overall approach is broadly applicable and can motivate empirical research, by providing insights into estimating the contribution of transportation infrastructures’ construction to a regional economy, along with a decision-making tool for transport policy, regional planning, and economic growth.},

Using National Establishment Time-Series business data, the research shows that business survival was significantly lower among businesses within 400 meters of stations, where cut and cover construction was used. A difference-in-differences technique was employed to determine whether revenue loss was the main mechanism by which businesses were displaced, but revenue loss was not found to be significant. The increased failure rate provides evidence that construction effects of mitigation programs for businesses should be standard practice when building new transit lines. Further research and data collection on business tenure are needed to understand the dynamics of business displacement around transit and to make such programs more effective.},

  abstract = {In China, the feasibility of metros has been questioned because of concerns about their financial burden and their concentration in large cites. However, academics have shown greater tolerance, recognizing the extensive local externalities of metro systems. This paper contributes to the literature by extending the focus on metro externalities to the regional level. Firstly, based on the New Economic Geography theoretical framework, this paper hypothesizes that the presence of a metro in a large city can enhance the economic vitality of a smaller neighboring city. Secondly, using the Yangtze River Delta region of China as a case study, this paper employs the spatial Durbin model and the difference-in-differences model to demonstrate that a 1\% increase in metro density in large cities correlates with a 3.6\% increase in the density of new firms in smaller cities. Additionally, the density of new firms in the peripheral counties of smaller cities near the metro increases by 5.8\%. The findings indicate that metro systems exert positive spillover effects at the regional level and do not monopolize the economic dynamism of smaller cities in China. Existing studies have undervalued the potential of metro externalities to enhance regional economic vitality. Therefore, it is recommended that the government consider relaxing restrictions on metro projects at an appropriate time in the future.},

A theoretical framework is developed where impacts of transport infrastructure on spatial economic development are measured in terms of productivity changes and (re)location behaviour. The transmission takes place via changes in generalized transport costs and accessibility. Methods for analyzing transport infrastructure impacts are classified according to the level of aggregation of the data (aggregate versus disaggregate) and the degree of model use (modelling versus nonmodelling approaches). Two spatial levels are distinguished: intra-urban versus intraregional. At the intraregional level it is found that integrated land use-transport models usually yield infrastructure impacts of limited size. Much larger impacts are usually found when entrepreneurs are directly interviewed about these impacts as they perceive them. At the interregional level, production function approaches usually lead to the conclusion that infrastructure supply has a considerable impact on the productivity of other production factors. On the other hand, the relocation impacts of transport infrastructure on economic activity as predicted by multiregional models are usually limited.}

In terms of methodology, research may be conducted using the following methods: cost benefit analysis (CBA) and multi-criteria analysis (MCA), accessibility and potential models, econometric production function estimates, regional modelling, trade and input-output (IO) modelling, Land Use-Transport Interaction (LUTI) or spatial computable general equilibrium (SCGE) models. In the European Union, approaches based on cost-benefit analysis (CBA), or possibly multi-criteria analysis (MCA), continue to prevail. Notwithstanding the availability of a wide range of methods for quantifying socio-economic impacts, the European Union recommends that wider economic impacts at the regional and national levels be assessed by means of qualitative approaches. This being the case, it is recommendable for the European Commission to take broad-ranging action towards ensuring that the effects of transport infrastructure investments are assessed by means of a broader range of approaches.},

  abstract = {This paper analyses the role of railroad development in employment subcentre formation in the Paris metropolitan area between 1968 and 2018. Over half a century, approximately 1.5 million new jobs were created; however, their spatial distribution across the Île-de-France region was uneven. Paris intramuros has lost 123,000 jobs for the 50-year period, while the Grande Couronne (outer periphery) accounted for 2/3 of employment growth. These dramatic changes in the geography of employment in the Paris metropolitan region were coupled with cardinal alterations in railroad transportation, whose network has expanded and whose branches have been intertwined in order to improve population mobility and, to some extent, decentralise the capital area in favour of the development of peripheral territories. The construction of the Réseau Express Régional (RER) on the basis of 19th century railroads together with formation of the Transilien network were stepping stones towards today’s efficient rapid transit system. Our investigation, using McMillen (2001) method to identify subcentres as well as the IV approach to determine the role of railway transport development in local employment growth and the evolution of urban spatial structures, corroborates the decisive role of RER in fostering employment and in the emergence of employment subcentres. Specifically, the proximity to a railway station boosts employment in the commune. For RER stations, this effect is more substantial and heterogeneous across space, being of greater magnitude for municipalities more distant from the CBD. Furthermore, the presence of a railway station in a commune increases its probability of being a (part of) subcentre from 19.3\% to 41.3\% depending on the period. Moreover, this effect is of greater magnitude for the presence of a RER station in a municipality (53.2\%–76.1\%). Interestingly, we cannot confirm that the influence of a railway station on subcentre formation spills over the edge of the commune where it is located.},

Our objective is to analyze the effects and consequences of the construction of a tramway line in some neighborhoods and municipalities of the agglomeration. These localizations are confronted to isolation and concentration of unfavorable socio-economic characteristics. Among other things, this line has permitted to facilitate the access to the historical job center of Bordeaux for inhabitants concerned. We use difference-in-differences methods to compare labor market outcomes of inhabitants who benefit from this better access with others who do not, before and after the construction. Results show that if unemployment rate has globally decreased on the period observed, the decrease is more important for neighborhoods located close to tramway stations. More generally, it seems that the tramway project helped to reduce some socio-economic inequalities in the agglomeration of Bordeaux.},

  abstract = {Over the past 20 years, California has made substantial investments in intra-metropolitan passenger rail infrastructure, expanding existing systems and building new ones. According to advocates of New Urbanism, such investment should encourage the growth of mixed-use transit-oriented development, defined as a high-density mix of residential and commercial uses within walking distance of rail stations. Little research to date has examined whether rail investment stimulates retail activity, which is a key component of mixed-use development. In this paper, I test whether the opening of new rail stations across California’s four largest metropolitan areas is associated with changes in retail employment near the stations. Results indicate that new rail stations were located in areas with previously high employment density, somewhat outside the city centres. New station openings are not significantly associated with differences in retail employment in three of the four MSAs, and negatively associated with retail in the Sacramento MSA. There is weak evidence that areas around new suburban stations serving commuter rail lines are more likely to gain retail employment, while centrally located, intra-city rail stations see decreases in retail activity.},

The best reviews synthesize studies to draw broad theoretical conclusions about what a literature means, linking theory to evidence and evidence to theory. This guide describes how to plan, conduct, organize, and present a systematic review of quantitative (meta-analysis) or qualitative (narrative review, meta-synthesis) information. We outline core standards and principles and describe commonly encountered problems. Although this guide targets psychological scientists, its high level of abstraction makes it potentially relevant to any subject area or discipline. We argue that systematic reviews are a key methodology for clarifying whether and how research findings replicate and for explaining possible inconsistencies, and we call for researchers to conduct systematic reviews to help elucidate whether there is a replication crisis.},

While the importance of the local amenity mix has been established as a key determinant of local livability, its link to urban transport infrastructure remains understudied, partially due to a lack of data. Using spatiotemporal social media data from Foursquare, we analyze the impact of metro stations which opened between 2014 and 2017 on the amenity mix of surrounding neighborhoods in nine European cities: Rome, Milan, Barcelona, Budapest, Warsaw, Sofia, Vienna, Helsinki, and Stuttgart. Thereby, we study three properties of the local amenity mix: its density, multifunctionality, and the heterogeneity between amenity types. For this purpose, we propose a new measurement of multifunctionality, which calculates the entropy of the locally present amenity set incorporating the degree of similarity between amenity types. For causal inference, we use Difference-in-Difference Regression based on Propensity Score Matching and Entropy Balancing. Our findings show that in most cities, subway expansion had a significant positive impact on the local amenity density and multifunctionality and that especially the social amenities—Arts \& Entertainment, Restaurants and Nightlife—responded strongly. Moreover, considerable agglomeration forces seem to prevail, causing existing subcenters to benefit most from new metro stations.},

In this paper, we examine this dynamic through in‐depth interviews with small business owners in proximity to new transit stations in Phoenix, Arizona; Seattle, Washington; and Charlotte, North Carolina to probe the opportunities and challenges faced within these locations. Overall, more challenges were raised including perceptions of an increased homeless population around stations, elevated rents, and increased vehicular traffic. Positive factors included increased foot traffic and proximity to customers.

En general, se plantearon retos adicionales, como la percepción de un aumento de la población de personas sin hogar en los alrededores de las estaciones, alquileres elevados y un aumento del tráfico de vehículos. Entre los factores positivos se mencionó el aumento del tráfico peatonal y la proximidad a los clientes. 抄録 ライトレールの駅への近接性は、それが人の往来や顧客の増加につながるならば、スモールビジネスにとって有利となる可能性があり、あるいは、賃料の上昇や商業的ジェントリフィケーションの脅威に直面するような問題になる可能性もある。本稿では、アリゾナ州フェニックス、ワシントン州シアトル、ノースカロライナ州シャーロットにおける、新しいトランジット駅に近接するスモールビジネスのオーナーとの詳細なインタビューによりこの動態を検討し、これらの立地が直面する機会と課題を調査した。全体としては、駅周辺のホームレス人口の増加、賃料の上昇、車両交通量の増加など、多くの課題が挙げられた。プラスの要因としては、人の往来の増加と顧客との近接性などが挙げられた。},

  abstract = {The urban transit system is considered the backbone of any society as it heavily depends on economic progress. The railway transit system is crucial for any urban transit system. Based on this notion, the present research explores the industrial agglomeration in China’s prefecture-level and cities from 2010 to 2020. The research analyses the processes of urban rail transit building, industrial agglomeration, and labor agglomeration due to the railway’s transit network development. The findings are summarized in three main points; first, the agglomeration of the labor force is positively affected by the construction of urban rail transit infrastructure. Secondly, the development of railways infrastructure stimulates the agglomeration of manufacturing industries in and near urban population centers leading to the development of services industries. Third, the development and integration of railways networks with other transportation networks also optimize the allocation of capital in these areas as well. In the present research Preacher and Hayes, Behavior research methods, 2008, 40 (3), 879–891 methodology has been applied to determine the relationship between the development of railways transit system and concentration of industries, by taking into account the mediating effects of labor agglomeration. The development of railways network tends to bring economic and industrial development to these regions resulting in overall social development.},

We use datasets which include geographic, transportation, and socioeconomic characteristics of California counties and cities from 1950 to 2010. Propensity score, one-to-one matching models are employed to draw units from the control group, which are counties/cities that do not have a state-supported Amtrak station, to match with units from the treatment group, which are counties/cities that do. Using regression analysis, we find that state-support Amtrak stations have significant effect on local population in the long term, and the effect increases with time. However, the effect on civilian employment is almost non-existent. This suggests that state-supported Amtrak services can provide quality rail mobility and accessibility, which attract people to live in a rail-accessible region. However, the economic influence seems limited.},

This paper explores the health, environmental, social and economic impacts of light rail transit, a component of the City of Hamilton’s rapid transit initiative. It performs a comparative analysis with other major North American cities that have successfully implemented this form of mass transit. The analysis concentrates on three main areas: urban development and land values, health and environmental impact and socio-economic factors. The results of the research on light rail transit (LRT) and its possible benefits indicate overwhelming support for the economic, health, environmental and social benefits of LRT, especially when compared to other forms of transit, including rapid bus and local transit schemes. According to the results, LRT in a medium sized, growing city such as Hamilton should be considered a viable and desirable transit option; a catalyst for transit oriented, high density, mixed use development; an economically sound investment opportunity, providing a return on investment to property owners, businesses and the municipality; and a catalyst for social change, improving the health, environment and connectivity of the community.},

It is argued that these productivity effects, particularly when combined with distortionary taxation, are quantitatively important, substantially increasing the gains attributable to urban transport improvements.},

One is economic density and productivity, a second is induced private investment and associated land-use change, and a third is employment effects. There are relatively well-established methodologies for incorporating the first and third of these in cost-benefit appraisal, and these methodologies are reviewed in the paper. For the second, the paper outlines how transport induced investments can create consumer surplus, and describes a method for quantifying this in cost-benefit appraisal. Data issues encountered in implementing these methods are discussed.},

  abstract = {Although it is widely reported that rail transit has the potential to encourage higher density development, it remains unclear whether rail transit leads to more mixed urban development across station areas. This article provides rare quantitative analysis of changes in land use mix around the rail transit system in Tianjin, China through an investigation into the spatial effects of a rail transit line which cuts across both highly developed and less developed areas. By using longitudinal data over a twelve-year period (2004–2016) and by comparing the entropy-based land-use mix index, the study shows that with the operation of rail transit, land use mix has increased in formerly low-mixed station catchments, but the change is not obvious for already highly diverse areas. It also shows that a more balanced development occurs in station areas with higher land use dominance, while the leading functions are intensified in station areas with lower land use dominance. By presenting a clear picture of the spatial distribution and patterns of land use mix changes over time, this article concludes that rail transit leads to more balanced development across different station areas in the context of China’s rapid urbanization. The outcome provides a base for further exploring how the planning of rail transit stations may help tackle the differentiated development in cities.},

The model produced a realistic urban pattern for 2018 with overall accuracy exceeding 95\%, Kappa coefficient exceeding 70\% and figure-of-merit exceeding 32\%, indicating the model’s ability to accurately capture urban dynamics. We predicted three different scenarios: a benchmark scenario of business as usual (BAU), a scenario focusing on LRTS, and an individual-factor-based scenario (ILRTS). The results show that the annual urban development intensity has the strongest correlation with LRT stations for LRTS-scenario, followed by ILRTS-scenario and BAU-scenario. The model can be readily applied elsewhere to assess the impact of urban infrastructure on future development.},

Results suggested that by reducing communication costs and increasing opportunities for interaction, subway construction would bring growth at the district level. Knowledge dissemination would become more active after new stations open. Micro-level results showed that these positive impacts were highly localized; that is, only those firms located within 1km around stations benefited from the new subway. Moreover, new subways facilitated the flow of knowledge from station to station and assisted firms in acquiring knowledge from more distant technology clusters conveniently.},

Using cross sectional data on over 24,000 establishment-year observations of retail stores, restaurants and personal services establishments, we examine how the construction and opening of the Green Line Light Rail Transit in Minneapolis and St. Paul affected sales volume and employment at nearby businesses. Using pre-and-post construction local polynomial regressions, we find that establishments within about 750 meters of a new transit station are negatively affected by transit station opening, and integrate this distance threshold into event study difference-in-differences mod- els that allow us to estimate how treatment effects change over time. We find that single location firms’ sales volumes begin to experience a 13\% reduction (compared to untreated establishments) about two years after LRT becomes operational but are unaffected during construction. By contrast establishments owned by firms with mul- tiple locations do not experience significant sales volume effects. Employment at both types of establishments was unaffected. We test the robustness of models and explore potential explanations for results.},

Yet only few studies have reported the impact of transit access on commercial property value. This paper presents empirical evidence from Wuhan, China, to enrich the knowledge in the subject area. Spatial autoregressive models were employed to estimate the commercial value capture, based on 676 observations along Wuhan’s metro rail line through the main business districts. Value appreciation was discovered within the 400m radius of road network distance from Metro stations. The transit access premiums present as two tiers: 16.7\% for the 0–100m core area and approximately 8.0\% within the 100–400m radius. The result demonstrates the potential benefit of adopting value capture and optimising TOD planning to support sustainable urban rail transit investment. Amid rapid urbanisation in China, the evidence reported here could help better inform cities, across the developing world and beyond, of the benefits of adopting rail transit-based policy.},

With the improvement of the financial development level, the alleviating effect of urban rail transit on corporate financing constraints is less pronounced.

We use geo-coded firm-level longitudinal data and apply geographical informational software (GIS) to draw a 50~×~50 grid on to the map. For each grid-cell, we count the number of startup firms and use each grid-cell as an observation unit for regressions. The kernel density estimation uncovers the distributional change of startups of different distances to the nearest transit stations and graphically shows that within 1 km areas of transit stations experience a surge of new startups. Using difference-in-differences Poisson regression with matching methods, we find the effect of the transit on nearby business formation is significant: the number of retail and technology firms increases by 42\% and 29\% respectively, while the effects are relatively insignificant and weak for business service, construction, and manufacture firms. Further, we provide evidence that the transit effects are heterogeneous in terms of firm size and spatial dimension. First, the positive effects fade away in distance, and the attenuation is larger for technology than retail firms. Second, the agglomeration effects triggered by the new transit mostly come from firms with large registered capital. We posit that in addition to agglomeration benefits to firms, transit development also causes urban congestion costs that raise business operating cost and potentially negatively impact the small firms that are cost-sensitive.},

Yet research that links industrial agglomeration with rail transit is scant—what types of industries are likely to cluster near rail stations? To what extent can rail transit access be seen as having an influence on industrial agglomeration? And how do these interactions vary as rail transit proximity increases? To answer these and related questions, we investigate the relationship between industrial agglomeration and rail transit in the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area using the Longitudinal Employer Dynamics (LEHD) employment data from 2014 at the census block level. First, we use the Local Indicator of Spatial Association statistics (LISA) tests to identify industrial agglomeration patterns within the study area. We then use logistics models to reveal the relationship between rail transit proximity and industrial agglomeration. Our study finds that the impacts of rail transit on industrial agglomeration, in terms of magnitudes and signs, are mixed across industries. The varying results suggest that the benefits of rail transit access exhibit considerable demand from certain industry sectors including the manufacturing, knowledge, and services industries, while exerting weaker forces in pulling agglomeration in its immediate environs among other industries (including the retail trade sector). In practice, these results are useful for justifying evidence-based rail transit planning.},

Meanwhile, cross-city metro operations tend to increase economic concentrations in larger cities and expand GDP inequalities between cities connected by a cross-city metro. Our mechanism analyses further corroborate that a higher metro density has a positive effect on urban employment growth and a negative effect on the average wage of employees, but this does not improve urban total factor productivity (TFP), suggesting that a metro system is more likely to provide consumption amenities and employment access than it is to provide production amenities.},

  abstract = {Beijing has made enormous investment in rail transit since the late 2000s. The rapidly growing subway system greatly improves the accessibility of neighborhoods nearby subway stations and often increases neighborhood population and employment densities, both resulting in a larger market for local retail businesses. While numerous studies have shown that rail transit investment tends to raise property value close to stations, few have provided direct evidence on rail transit's effects on local consumer amenities. Using citywide catering establishment data since 2004 from dianping.com (China's yelp.com), we study the effects of new subway stations on catering openings, diversity and consumer demand in neighborhoods near a subway station opened during 2004–2013. We find that a new subway station positively contributes to the quantity, diversity and consumer demand of nearby food and beverage services. These effects are heterogeneous spatially and in terms of catering types. This study enriches the limited extant empirical evidence on urban rail transit's impact on local economic activities and consumer amenities. In China, where unprecedented rail transit expansion has transformed large cities like Beijing in many ways, our findings can help us better understand how major public investment in cities affects local economy, quality of life, the housing market and related further policy concerns.},

  abstract = {While numerous studies have shown that rail transit investment increases property value close to stations, not much has been said on the transit-induced indirect changes in neighborhood amenities and their role in property market's response to transit investment. The rapid expansion of Beijing's subway system over the last decade provides a precious opportunity to research the transit—retail amenities—property value connection. This paper enhances our knowledge by studying how local consumer amenities react to urban rail transit development and subsequently reflect in consumers’ willingness to pay. Using multiyear subway construction history, station neighborhoods’ restaurant activities and rental housing transactions in Beijing, we find a new subway station positively contributes to the number of new openings and the diversity of nearby restaurants. The changes in neighborhood restaurant activities capture 20–40\% of the home value appreciation following the construction of a subway station. Our findings support the “multiplier effect” of neighborhood retail amenities in rail transit's impact on local home value. The public investment in transit and the private market responses complement each other and together contribute toward urban quality of life, as revealed by the appreciation in local property values.},

  abstract = {We perform a welfare analysis of transport infrastructure improvements in the presence of an imperfect labor market, allowing for endogenous wages and involuntary unemployment. Efficiency wage setting is incorporated in a spatial two-region general equilibrium model, written as a welfare program. In our model, firms set wages above the market clearing level to create an inducement for employees not to shirk. The economy-wide effect (i.e. social welfare or total welfare) consists of the direct effect in transport market and the indirect effect in other markets. We conduct welfare analyses different from the conventional cost–benefit analysis, in which we distinguish between the direct welfare effect based on consumer surplus in the transport market and the indirect welfare effect through changes in regional unemployment, which is captured in the economy-wide effect. In our model, infrastructure improvement may increase unemployment in one region, but overall unemployment levels fall. The indirect welfare effects through decreases in overall unemployment are about 10–20\% of the direct welfare effects for most plausible labor market parameters. The indirect welfare effects are larger, the poorer the initial transport infrastructure and the larger the labor market imperfections.},

  abstract = {The increasing demand for shared mobility services has led to multiple Public-Private Partnerships (PPP), where public transit agencies and mobility providers work together to increase transit service coverage. However, several partnerships have failed due to budget constraints and lack of ridership. Furthermore, the limited data -sharing agreements restrict the analysis and dissemination of outcomes. This paper analyzes the integration of shared-mobility services into the public transit system using data from pilot programs in Austin, Texas. The use of Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) and microtransit service is evaluated as first-mile-last-mile (FMLM) and door-to-door solutions. The associated TNC, microtransit, and bus transit demand are analyzed using ridership data, and the trip characteristics are discussed and compared. Then, after controlling for con-founding variables through matching, a difference-in-differences (DID) model is used to infer the effect of mi-crotransit on bus transit demand. Specifically, by evaluating bus ridership before and after implementing the microtransit program, the DID model estimates the change in bus demand attributed to microtransit. The results suggest that the TNC services, focusing only on FMLM, were not as popular as microtransit services offering FMLM and intrazonal trips. Even though the microtransit trips were longer and, in some cases, the driver re-sponse times were higher than for TNC trips. Also, the DID model demonstrates that the microtransit service did not substantially impact the bus transit ridership, suggesting that the trips were mainly used for intrazonal door-to-door trips and not for FMLM trips. A further discussion highlights the need for performance metrics beyond demand and costs to capture the benefits of these partnerships for improving mobility, safety, and customer experience.},
